### glTF PoC Principles

All of CityGML 3.0 in glTF should be encoded (or plausibly encodable).

A replica should have complete visualization functionally in off-the-shelf glTF loaders and viewers.

GeoPose 1.0 should be used wherever the underlying concept is expressed, for example in the relationship between a world geodetic reference frame and glTF coordinates or in the anchoring of dynamic or virtual features withing the modelled environment.

Remote content storage should be used, if required to obtain an efficient encoding.
