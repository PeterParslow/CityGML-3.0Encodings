=== Vegetation Conformance Class

The Vegetation module supports representation of vegetation objects with vegetation- specific thematic classes. CityGMLâ€™s vegetation model distinguishes between solitary vegetation objects like trees, and vegetation areas which represent biotopes like forests or other plant communities.

The Vegetation Conformance Class implements the following Requirements Class from the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model Standard:

* Vegetation: http://www.opengis.net/spec/CityGML-1/3.0/req/req-class-vegetation

The applicable GML schema is http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/3.0/vegetation.xsd[vegetation.xsd].

==== Dependencies

The Appearance Requirements Class is dependent on the following Requirements Class from this standard:

* The <<core-section,Core>> Requirements Class which is the only mandatory Requirements Class. This class contains foundational elements upon which a CityGML dataset is built. The <<core-section,Core>> Requirements Class also defines XML elements and types reused by other Requirements Classes.

In addition, the Appearance Requirements Class is dependent on the following external OGC and ISO standards:

* <<ogc07-036,GML 3.2>> provides most of the geometry types (e.g., Point, LineString, Polygon) used for spatial representations in this standard. Defines Coordinate Reference Systems. Supports the General Feature Model upon which this standard is based.

* <<ogc10-129r1,GML 3.3>> defines compact encodings of geometry types, linear referencing concepts (e.g., linear element, distance along, Linear Referencing Methods), TINs, and encoding rules for association classes.

==== Implementation Decisions

The following decisions have been made regarding implementation of the CityGML 3.0 Vegetation conformance class in GML.

. All associations allow by default that the referenced features can be provided inline or by reference.
